###Google Summer of Code Projects for [Processing.org](https://processing.org/)

This project is broken up into roughly three useful parts, focusing on streaming media over the network, primarily video and audio streams. 

The first section of the project was modifications and extensions to the existing Processing network library. 

The second was upgrading Processing's video capability to use GStreamer 1.0 instead of the depreciated GStreamer 0.10 which Processing was previously relying. 

Finally, the third part of the project was creating a streaming library that allows Processing users to stream local videos and songs/audio files to other sketches and other computers.
