These sketches are examples of the new features added to the core Processing network library. NOTE: In order for these sketches to run, you also need my changes to the network library (currently in my forked branch from the Processing source code).

Key Changes:

- Access to the clientList and number of clients from the server objects
- New event handling for disconnections
- the event handler serverEvent is now serverEvent(Server, Client, String), which can be either "connect" or "disconnect"

TODO: make these a static final in Server or an event object
